# Import Images with Masks

This app allows you to upload images with annotations in the format of PNG masks. Masks are 3-(1-)channel images containing only pixels that have the same values in all channels. To map pixels masks with appropriate class you can use specific config:

#### Example 1.

```json
{
  "classes_mapping": {
    "Lemon": 170,
    "Kiwi": 85
  }
}
```

In this configuration example all pixels in the mask which value **equal to 170** will be combined in one Bitmap figure and will be assigned to the class **"Lemon"** and **equal to 85** will be assigned to the class **"Kiwi"**.

#### Example 2.

```json
{
  "classes_mapping": {
    "Fruits": [85, 170],
    "Car": 3
  }
}
```

In this case all pixels in the mask which value **equal to 85 or 170** will be combined in one Bitmap figure and will be assigned to the class **"Fruits"** and all pixels **equal to 3** will be assinged to the class **"Car"**.

#### Example 3.

```json
{
  "classes_mapping": {
    "objects": "__all__"
  }
}
```

In this case all pixels in the mask which value **greater than 0** will be combined in one Bitmap figure and will be assigned to the class "objects":

Also you don't have to specify any configs, in this case default config will be used:

```json
{
  "classes_mapping": {
    "untitled": "__all__"
  }
}
```

Images should be in the folder `"img"` and mask should be in the folder `"ann"` and should have the same name as the images(but may have a different extension). All images will be  placed in dataset **ds**.

File structure that can be uploaded by this plugin should look like this:

```
.
├── ann
│   ├── image_1.png
│   ├── image_2.png
│   └── image_3.png
└── img
    ├── image_1.png
    ├── image_2.png
    └── image_3.png

```
